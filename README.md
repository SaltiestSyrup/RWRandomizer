# Rain World Randomizer
This is a randomizer mod that forces players to complete "checks" to unlock various game elements such as gates to other regions and karma increases.
Gates to other regions will start locked, and must be opened through progression.

The Steam Workshop page for this mod can be [found here](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3323349183).

## How it works
In order to progress in the game, you will have to complete certain checks, such as:
- Passage completion
- Colored pearl collection
- Sandbox token collection
- Meeting Echoes
- Other story objectives

These will unlock progression in the form of:
- Gates becoming passable
- Karma increases
- Passage tokens
- Story items

Most of these can be toggled on or off in the Remix settings to customize your generation.
**Note**: If too many check types are disabled, you may be unable to generate. It is recommended to enable as many as you're comfortable with for the best experience.

# Archipelago
The mod is currently in a beta state for Archipelago, a multi-game randomizer tool. Instructions for setting up Archipelago can be found at the [website](https://archipelago.gg/).

The latest release for the APworld needed to use Archipelago with this game can be [found here](https://github.com/alphappy/ArchipelagoRW/releases).

Thorough documentation for this game's Archipelago implementation can be [found here](https://github.com/alphappy/ArchipelagoRW/blob/main/worlds/rain_world/docs/README.md).

# Manual Installation
You may want to manually install this mod rather than using Steam if you need an older version for Archipelago or Rain World 1.9

Instructions for doing so:
1. Download the desired version from the [releases page](https://github.com/SaltiestSyrup/RWRandomizer/releases)
2. Find your game's mod directory at `Rain World\RainWorld_Data\StreamingAssets\mods`
   - For Steam installations, your game folder can be found by clicking the gear icon on the game's page in Steam, and selecting "View local files"
3. Extract the downloaded zip file into the mod directory, so that you see the "rwrandomizer" folder next to the other base game mods
4. You should now be able to launch the game and enable it via Remix
