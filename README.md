# Rain World Randomizer
This is a randomizer mod that forces players to complete "checks" to unlock various game elements such as gates to other regions and karma increases.
Gates to other regions will start locked, and must be opened through progression

## How it works
In order to progress in the game, you will have to complete certain checks, such as:
- Passage completion
- Colored pearl collection
- Sandbox token collection
- Meeting Echoes
- Other story objectives

These will unlock progression in the form of:
- Gates becoming passable
- Karma increases
- Passage tokens
- Story items

Most of these can be toggled on or off in the Remix settings to customize your playstyle

# Archipelago
The mod is currently in an alpha state for Archipelago support. The latest release can be found in the releases page

## Mod Installation
Download the latest version, and unzip it into your game's mod directory
(`steamapps\common\Rain World\RainWorld_Data\StreamingAssets\mods`).

When you boot up the game, you should see it in the Remix menu. Enable it, and you will get a prompt to restart your game. 
You should now return to the Remix menu and click the enabled mod to access the Remix settings. Once there, click on the Archipelago tab and check the box labeled "Enabled Archipelago". 
The options should light up, and you can now enter the login information to connect to your MultiWorld. Once the information is entered, click "Connect" and the game will attempt to connect to the server.
Once connected, you can start the game by going into story mode as normal and starting a new game as the slugcat specified in your .yaml

Note: Make sure if you're using "Passage Progress without Survivor" to have the Remix mod enabled. Your enabled DLC mods must also match exactly with your .yaml
