# Rain World Randomizer
This is a randomizer mod that forces players to complete "checks" to unlock various game elements such as gates to other regions and karma increases.
Gates to other regions will start locked, and must be opened through progression

## How it works
In order to progress in the game, you will have to complete certain checks, such as:
- Passage completion
- Colored pearl collection
- Sandbox token collection
- Meeting Echoes
- Other story objectives

These will unlock progression in the form of:
- Gates becoming passable
- Karma increases
- Passage tokens
- Story items

Most of these can be toggled on or off in the Remix settings to customize your playstyle
